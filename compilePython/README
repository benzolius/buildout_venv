Compiling Python interpreter

The initBuildout.sh script will compile Python version 2.7.8
You should adjust version numbers and folder name in the script and in buildout.cfg if necessary.

The installation process will install the interpreter in the created folder: /opt/py/py278

If the user has no permission to create folder in /opt, then change the folder name, or you could give permissions:

sudo mkdir /opt/py
chown $USER:$USER /opt/py
